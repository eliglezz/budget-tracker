## Description
Web app that allows a user to track their budget. This budget tracker front end was provided. I added the serviceworker and manifest. The web app is deployed on Heroku but is fully functional offline. The database and website will sync once internet connection is restored.<br>
## Installation
Fork the repo, Clone the repo. Run `npm i` in the terminal to get the necessary packages. Now run `node seeds` in the terminal to seed the database. After the user must `node server.js` to run the local server. The user should now be able to use the app localhost if they are running their own Mongo Database.<br>
